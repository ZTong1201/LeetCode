     * Given a m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently
     * in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:
     * 1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])
     * 2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
     * 3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])
     * 4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])
     * Notice that there could be some invalid signs on the cells of the grid which points outside the grid.
     * <p>
     * You will initially start at the upper left cell (0,0). A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper
     * left cell (0,0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path
     * doesn't have to be the shortest.
     * <p>
     * You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.
     * <p>
     * Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.
     * <p>
     * Constraints:
     * <p>
     * m == grid.length
     * n == grid[i].length
     * 1 <= m, n <= 100
     * <p>
     * Approach 1: Modified Dijkstra Algorithm
     * The key to this problem is translating the question into finding the shortest path in the graph. We can denote the
     * entire grid as a weighted graph, where each cell has at most weighted edges to its adjacent cells, the weight will be
     * 0 if the direction is correct (one can move from current cell to its neighbor), otherwise 1. Then we can start from
     * the cell (0, 0) and each time we will take the edge with the least weight, i.e. we will pick all 0 edges first. Then
     * we will move to other reachable cells by taking some cost. Since the smallest cost will always be taken at each step,
     * it's guaranteed that the cost will be the minimum when (m - 1, n - 1) is first reached.
     * <p>
     * Time: O(mn * log(mn)) For each cell, we have at most 4 edges, hence in total we can have 4*mn edges. These edges will
     * need to be added into the heap, so the size of heap is O(mn) and removing the smallest from the heap at each step
     * takes O(log(mn) time, and we need to go through the entire grid in the worst case
     * Space: O(mn)

     * the target. In that scenario, we will use those nodes we already visited as starting point, change the direction, and

     * we need to change one more direction before getting the destination. We could use a 2-D array to server 2 purposes

     * the cost is updated, then we know the cell has been visited, and we wouldn't visit it again.
