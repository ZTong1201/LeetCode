    /**
     * Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.
     * <p>
     * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
     * <p>
     * Constraints:
     * <p>
     * m == board.length
     * n == board[i].length
     * 1 <= m, n <= 200
     * board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
     * <p>
     * Approach: DFS
     * Basically, the key part of this problem is to avoid flipping any 'O's to 'X's if it connects to the border. Then, we can
     * first traverse all the cells on the boundary and mark them as inaccessible (e.g. flip those 'O's into '*'s). We can now
     * safely change any connected 'O's into 'X's afterwards. Eventually, we need to go through the board again to flip those
     * '*'s into 'O's.
     * 1. change our connected 'O's to the borders into '*'s
     * 2. change the rest of 'O's into 'X's
     * 3. change the '*'s back to 'O's
     * <p>
     * Time: O(mn) in the worst case, we traverse the entire grid 3 times
     * Space: O(mn) for the call stack
