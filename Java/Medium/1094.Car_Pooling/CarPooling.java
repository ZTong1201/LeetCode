    /**
     * There is a car with capacity empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).
     * <p>
     * You are given the integer capacity and an array trips where trip[i] = [numPassengersi, fromi, toi] indicates that the
     * ith trip has numPassengersi passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are fromi and toi
     * respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.
     * <p>
     * Return true if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or false otherwise.
     * <p>
     * Constraints:
     * <p>
     * 1 <= trips.length <= 1000
     * trips[i].length == 3
     * 1 <= numPassengersi <= 100
     * 0 <= fromi < toi <= 1000
     * 1 <= capacity <= 10^5
     * <p>
     * Approach 1: Sort + Heap
     * We'd like to iterate over the trip from the smallest distance to the largest. If there is an overlap between the new
     * trip and the existing trips, we need to keep adding passengers. If at any time it exceeds the capacity, we can directly
     * return false. If the new trip has no overlap with previous trips, we can unload some passengers and remove those
     * trips. In order to loop through trips from the smallest to the largest, we need to sort the array first. Then for
     * all existing trips, we add it into a max heap, where the top value has the furthest distance of all existing trips.
     * <p>
     * Time: O(nlogn) sorting takes O(nlogn) time, and we also need a heap to keep track of existing trips, which may have
     * up to O(n) trips, removing and adding operations will take O(logn) time, each trip will be added and removed at most
     * once each. Hence, in total it's O(nlogn) runtime
     * Space: O(n)

     * Approach 2: Sweep Line
     * The algorithm will be simply adding passengers when entering an event and removing passengers when leaving an event.
     * Therefore, this could be done by using a sweep line approach. Essentially, we keep a tree map (why tree map? because
     * sweep line needs to be done in a sorted order, we can get the order for free from tree map) and put a positive
     * passenger number to the from distance (meaning we add passengers at the beginning of the trip) and also put a negative
     * number to the to distance (meaning we remove passengers at the end of the trip). Then sweep each distance position,
     * add/remove passengers on the fly, if at any time it exceeds the capacity, then we must have been overloaded in between.
     * <p>
     * Time: O(nlogn) we need to add 2 * n events into a tree map in the worst case, we essentially sort these events using
     * a tree, hence it takes O(nlogn)
